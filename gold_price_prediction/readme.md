# Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of gold using various machine learning models, including a Random Forest Regressor and a Neural Network. The dataset used in this project is sourced from `gld_price_data.csv`. The performance of the models is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics. The results are visualized through plots comparing the predicted values with the actual values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- XGBoost

## Installation

To run this project, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost
```

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using pandas.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is performed using seaborn and matplotlib to understand the data characteristics through summary statistics and visualizations.

### Model Training

#### Random Forest Regressor

A Random Forest Regressor model is trained using Scikit-learn's RandomForestRegressor.

#### Neural Network

A Neural Network model is implemented using TensorFlow. The model architecture includes multiple Dense layers with ReLU activation functions.

### Results Visualization

The performance of the trained models is evaluated and visualized using Matplotlib. Plots comparing the predicted values with the ground truth are generated.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building and comparing machine learning models to predict the price of gold. The Random Forest Regressor and the Neural Network models were both trained and evaluated, with their performances compared using visualizations.

## Future Work

Future improvements could include:
- Hyperparameter tuning for the models.
- Using additional features or external datasets to improve model performance.
- Implementing other advanced machine learning algorithms for comparison.
